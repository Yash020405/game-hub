# Graph Game Hub 🎮

An interactive learning platform that makes graph algorithms fun and accessible through gamification. Learn complex computer science concepts by playing engaging games that visualize how algorithms work in real-time.

## 🎯 What is this?

Instead of staring at textbook diagrams, you can actually *play* with graph algorithms. Each game teaches you a different algorithm or concept through hands-on interaction. Whether you're a CS student trying to understand Dijkstra's algorithm or a developer wanting to brush up on graph theory, this platform makes learning intuitive and enjoyable.
